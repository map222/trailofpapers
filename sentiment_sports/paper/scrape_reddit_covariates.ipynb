    "# What drives sports player popularity\n",
    "The 2018 Cleveland Cavs made the NBA finals while generating some of the hottest memes of 2018 (\"We got an \\[expletive\\] squad now,\" \"He boomed me.\"). While following discussion of the Cavs on Reddit, I noticed something odd. Turkish rookie Cedi Osman was a particular fan favourite. Cedi played limited minutes with energy, and everyone joked that Cedi was the \"GOAT\" (Greatest Of All Time) carrying Lebron. In contrast, Tristan Thompson, a hero of the 2016 season, had an off year, and was the center of a meme for being traded, \"Shump, TT, and the Nets pick.\" For the Cavs, it commenters seemed to give the white players an easier time. And being a data scientist, I thought, \"I could measure that!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to use sentiment and econometric models to try to understand what makes NBA and NFL players popular. I split this project into three parts. Part 1 focuses on scraping player comments from Reddit, and how to download covariate data for players (e.g. performance and demographics). In part 2, I will isolate comments about single players using NER, and calculate sentiment towards those players. In part 3, I will use econometric regression models to investigate what drives player sentiment."

    "## Understanding public sentiment towards players\n",
    "To quantify how the public feels towards player, people in the past have used surveys like the Q-score. While surveys are a great tool for getting precise quantitative answers, they are inherently biased in important ways. First, not everyone responds to surveys, making the sample non-representative; and second, people may not feel like they can be honest in surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to surveys, we can try to understand how people feel towards players using their natural language. This replaces the survey-response bias with another bias overrepresenting people who speak more often. It also has some advantages: you can get information from a much larger set of people; and people are probably more honest in their appraisals when they don't know they are being measured. As such, I set out to measure the public's sentiment towards players using social media. (Plus, this was all I had access to.)\n",
    "### Scraping comment data from Reddit\n",
    "My primary source of player comments were the active [NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba) and [NFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl) subreddits. I also tried scraping Twitter, but the Twitter API was harder to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To scrape data, I primarily used the `pushshift` API (I originally used the `praw` module, code for which you can see at the end of this notebook). Since I wanted to scrape data over multiple years and subreddits, I took a note from [Joel Grus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U), and function-ified my notebook code. For the complete code, see the module `scrape_reddit_comments`.\n",
